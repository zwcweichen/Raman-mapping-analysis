# Raman-mapping-analysis
A Python-based tool for analyzing raw data from Raman mapping measurements. This program utilizes PyQt to create a user-friendly graphical interface, providing powerful and intuitive tools for experimental data analysis.

# Key Features
- 2D Mapping Generation
  - Creates 2D maps by integrating spectral intensity at each spatial position
  - Provides a visual representation of Raman signal distribution across the sample surface
- Fitting analysis
  - Performs fitting analysis on spectra at each spatial position
  - Generates 2D maps based on fitting parameters
- Profile Analysis
  - Extracts Raman spectral profiles along specific directions
  - Enables in-depth analysis of spatial variations in the sample
- Data Export
  - Supports exporting analysis results as txt files
  - Facilitates further processing and data sharing
